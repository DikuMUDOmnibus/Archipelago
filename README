This is a stripped down release of the code and minimal world files
for Archipelago.  The code has only been tested under Linux - but given
a reasonably gnu-ish system it should work.  As Archipelago is based on
CircleMud 2.2 all caveats and license restrictions apply.  This includes
The DikuMud license restrictions - that the original dikumud creators
names must appear in the login screen and credits.  If you plan on modifying
Archipelago it would be nice if the Archipelago team were creditied as well
and also Jeremy Elison of course.

I haven't had much time to prepare documentation - though I have included some
admitedly slightly dated html files from the Archipelago web site which
describe the environment.

The source code is considerably enhanced from the CircleMud 2.2 distribution.
Archipelago source weighs in at a smidgen over 60K lines, CircleMud 2.2 has
about 30K.  The source code is not well commented I'm afraid - but it is yours
to modify as you please (as long as you keep to the typical Circle/Diku
license agreements).
