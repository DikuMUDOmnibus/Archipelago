rod pleasant returns twig ash~
   This thin ash twig has been debarked and then sanded so it is as smooth
as river washed stone.  The twig is incredibly flexible and resilient, and
withstands every attempt you make to snap it in twain.  Surprisingly, each
time the twig is bent, a crackle of magical energy surges through the wood.
With each energy burst, you have visions of your home city.  Surely this is a
magical rod of pleasant returns!~
