Now this codfish is an interesting specimen.  You recall that the common
cod is both nutritous and tasty, providing many of the essential vitamins
and minerals required to keep rugged adventurers in tip top condition.
This particular fish looks rather as if it has been left in the sun for
too long, and brushed with chack dust to cover up this fact.  The
realisation dawns on you that you have been 'Fendled', rumours abound
about Fendle having poisoned the High priest with a particularly dodgy
example of a shark steak.  On careful consideration, you decide that this
one probably isn't poisonous, just rather a bad fish.

   Fifth, when you are able to enjoy a moment of rest, type 'commands'.  This,
coupled with the help files, might make life on Archipelago a bit easier.
   Finally you will need a place to rent when you are tired.  The nearest inn
is the Warrior's Widow.  The innkeeper can be found 2 west, 1 north, and 1 up
from the fountain.
   Best of luck!  Please feel free to ask for help, and do not feel shy in
directing any comments, complaints, or suggestions you may have on the
various boards about town.  To write on a board type `write <name of topic>'.
(Remember to include a carriage return <CR> after each line.)
~
E
hint1~
 
   First, give yourself a title by typing `title %n the great!'.  The %n in
the title is your name and is necessary.  Other %codes includable can be
found in the help file by typing 'help title'.  You can also add colour to
your title to give it that special pizzazz.  Type 'help ansi' to see what
%colour codes you can add.
   Second, although the immorts are generally stingy and not given to bouts
of gift giving, they recognize that you are new on the Archipelago and have
granted you some equipment.  Type `i' (inventory), and `eq' (equipment), to
see what has been bestowed upon you.  Your equipment has been resized to
personally fit you.  If you notice, there is a sword nestled in a scabbard.
To use that weapon, type `draw'.  To sheathe it, type `sheathe'.
~
E
hint2~
 
   Third, you will probably want to start gaining experience.  The best way
to do this is to start slowly.  Try battling the various bugs and other small
critters that surround the fountain.  Bugs, toads, and sparrows all make
excellent fodder for your sword.  Also avoid attacking any being with the
word `(citizen)' it its title.  If you do, they will alert the guards to your
murderous attacks and will whisper to other citizens - who will then become
hostile toward you.
   Fourth, you may want to visit the various guilds and wandering guildmasters
to obtain new skills, spells, and weapon proficiencies.  At the guildmaster,
type `learn' (for skills), `study' (for spells), and `train' (for weapons).  
As an example, to learn four levels of magic theory, type `learn 4 magic'.
The difficulty, or ease, in learning skills, spells and weapons is determined
by your ability statistics.

patina tarnishes the pewter.  Set in its center is a huge amethyst.  The
large gemstone, shaped like a turtle shell, is colored a deep purple, and
has a smoky clarity to it.~
