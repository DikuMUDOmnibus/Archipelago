Floating High Above Lamman~
   Behold!  You stand at the brink of high adventure, pulse quickening
danger, and magnificent treasures beyond your grandest dreams.  By some strange
cosmic force you have materialized here: the gateway to the vast realm known as
the Archipelago!
   Looking around, you are surprised to discover yourself standing on a
grayish-white cloud floating high above the ground.  Although standing here in
the clouds is quite cozy and safe, you begin to feel restless and look for a
way down from the sky.  Far below, you see a bubbling marble fountain in the
middle of the busy Market Square of the great harbour city of Lamman.  A
slender golden rope will help assist in your descent down.

The Central Fountain~
   This is the central hub of the entire market place.  It is dominated by an
imposing marble basin, into which water flows from a large statue of rather
dubious artistic merit.  Among the carefully cut flagstones surrounding the
fountain is a squarish block of polished granite inscribed with a map. It
seems so peaceful here with the %2gentle murmur of business activity all
around, the occasional nicker of horses as they drink from the fountain and
the %merry burble of water as it flows into the basin.  It's really a shame
you can't stay here all the time.

offer the finest lodgings in town.  Just to the south you can see the large

there is activity.  As you stand here, you brush shoulders with a wide range
of people, everyone from wealthy merchants to poor tramps and beggars.  You
hear the soothing babble of water dancing in a large marble fountain to the
east.  The Market Square extends off to the north and south, while a small
courtyard opens up to the west between the Warrior Widow Inn and a bakery.

   The busy market square of Lamman is filled with activity and noise.  There
are people everywhere you turn, each face unrecognizable from the last.
Everyone is busy running around on some errand, or busy hawking something you
may not need.  Loaming above this chaos, is the orderly Temple of Lamman to
the north.  Set up in this corner of the market are quite a few lending tables
set up by usurers interested in making quite a bit of money by bilking temple
worshippers and pilgrims of their gold.  Pauper's Row lies to the east.  The
market continues south and west.

Sigur's Armour Repair Smithy~
   Everyone knows that dwarves make the best blacksmiths, something to do with
surface area to volume ratios or some such thing.  To be sure, in Lamman the
blacksmiths are all dwarves.  No one is sure exactly how this came to be, but
some time ago a few trolls tried to set up a rival smithy in the heart of the
Troll Quarter.  Rumour has it there was an accident one night, and they were
found melted down in their own forge the next morning.
   Sigur is usually to be found here in his shop shaping steel plates into
armour for the City Watch.  By virtue of his skill at smithing armour, he has
a contract to forge armours for the King and the city guard.  Of course, a lack
of competition more than encourages it.  Despite a regular income, he still
insists in making a little extra coin on the side, and if not busy with other
things repairs the armour of adventurers in need.

      You are standing in the finest armoury in all of Lamman, at least that's
what Hurgood always says.  All manner of armour adorns the wall, armour for bits
of the body you never imagined needed armour and some for bits of the body you
can't imagine having! Hurgood himself is sitting at a bench hammering dents
from a breastplate.

back of the shop, calmly adding a killing edge to a huge axe. The grinding
wheel shoots sparks everywhere.

The Foyer of the Warrior's Widow Inn~
   This is the plush entry hall of the Warrior's Widow.  Small paintings of
slain heroes and dead fighters adorn the walls, their memories kept alive
here in this small gallery.  Also on the wall is a well-detailed map of
the city.  Scattered around the room are a few rickety tables and chairs of
unvarnished pine.  More tables and chairs can be found in the inn's bar and
restaurant to the north.
   A set of stairs leads up to the lodgings reception, if you want a room for
the night, that is where you should go.  The inn exits south onto a quaint
little road, and east onto the northwest part of Market Square.

and other labors, were raised to immortality.  There are names as innoculous
as Xero, and as pompous as Magnifico.  You also see the names of Ponder,

The Commons Room of the Warrior Widow Inn~
   This place is just bustling with activity.  There are several buxom
serving lasses running about carrying foaming mugs of ale and mead.  Several
merchants are here getting pretty drunk.  The city watch also likes to pop
in here every so often, for a quick libation.  Nearby, the bartender is
polishing a pewter mug while eavesdropping in on various conversations for
any juicy information that he can later sell to the secret police.  The
common room exits south into the foyer, and west into the inn's kitchens.

At the foot of the Temple Steps~
   Brightly polished marble steps lead up to the magnificent Temple of Lamman.
Many citizens of this fair city traipse up this rather grandiose staircase to
pay homage to the various deities that make their puny mortal lives worth
living.  To the south, the hustle and bustle of commerce, takes place out on
market square.  To the north, the ornate entrance to the temple offices can
be seen.  Before you take another step in any direction, you notice a squarish
block of polished granite embedded in the ground.  The stone is handsomely
inscribed with a map to aid those unfamilar with the layout of this fine city.

   This is where all the food for the inn's guests is stored and prepared.
It is a busy place.  The chef is hurrying about sampling dishes, and tasting
stuff.  His long beard is stained in many different colours and flavors.
There are also a few surly kitchen boys running about carrying cutlery and
dishes.  The inn's kitchen exits east.

As you step through the door reality seems to waver, you arn't quite sure
which way is up, or whether the walls are solid. There is so much magic
stored in this one place that it is warping the fabric of space. This is

The courtyard is paved with carefully cut flagstones and your footsteps echo
off the high walls on the north and south side of the courtyard.  One stone,
in particular, catches your eye.  It is a stone seemingly out of place.  It is
large and polished with a map inscribed on it.  An arched wooden gateway is on
the southside of the courtyard and the strong smell of horses can be detected
in that direction.  Courtyard Lane continues to the east, past the Warrior
Widow Inn and back towards the Market Square.  A dirt path leads north along
the River Ronnan.

mercenary companies allied with the city and various racks are evenly spaced
around the room to hold weapons not in use.  The Master of the Warrior's Guild
is usually to be found here, training the city guard and other aspiring 
novices in the warrior's art.

The Lamman Public Library~
   This is a beautiful facility provided by the townsfolk for the betterment
of the general populace.  Here, you can relax unmolested in peace, and catch
up on the latest news, and perhaps learn something new.  The library has many
books available, all of which are chained to rickety wooden shelves to help
prevent theft.  There are also maps displayed on the walls.  One map in
particular catches your eye.  This library exits east onto a wide paved muddy

moby dick~
Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating
the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I
can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
towards the ocean with me...

   Fifth, when you are able to enjoy a moment of rest, type 'commands'.  This,
coupled with the help files, might make life on Archipelago a bit easier.
   Finally you will need a place to rent when you are tired.  The nearest inn
is the Warrior's Widow.  The innkeeper can be found 2 west, 1 north, and 1 up
from the fountain.
   Best of luck!  Please feel free to ask for help, and do not feel shy in
directing any comments, complaints, or suggestions you may have on the
various boards about town.  To write on a board type `write <name of topic>'.
(Remember to include a carriage return <CR> after each line.)

hint2~
 
   Third, you will probably want to start gaining experience.  The best way
to do this is to start slowly.  Try battling the various bugs and other small
critters that surround the fountain.  Bugs, toads, and sparrows all make
excellent fodder for your sword.  Also avoid attacking any being with the
word `(citizen)' it its title.  If you do, they will alert the guards to your
murderous attacks and will whisper to other citizens - who will then become
hostile toward you.
   Fourth, you may want to visit the various guilds and wandering guildmasters
to obtain new skills, spells, and weapon proficiencies.  At the guildmaster,
type `learn' (for skills), `study' (for spells), and `train' (for weapons).  
As an example, to learn four levels of magic theory, type `learn 4 magic'.
The difficulty, or ease, in learning skills, spells and weapons is determined
by your ability statistics.
~
E
hint1~
 
   First, give yourself a title by typing `title %n the great!'.  The %n in
the title is your name and is necessary.  Other %codes includable can be
found in the help file by typing 'help title'.  You can also add colour to
your title to give it that special pizzazz.  Type 'help ansi' to see what
%colour codes you can add.
   Second, although the immorts are generally stingy and not given to bouts
of gift giving, they recognize that you are new on the Archipelago and have
granted you some equipment.  Type `i' (inventory), and `eq' (equipment), to
see what has been bestowed upon you.  Your equipment has been resized to
personally fit you.  If you notice, there is a sword nestled in a scabbard.
To use that weapon, type `draw'.  To sheathe it, type `sheathe'.

canterbury caunterbury tales tome~
 One of the books on the shelves catches your eye.  You read the golden letters
on the spine and discover that it is a copy of ``The Canterbury Tales''.  It
begins...

   Here bygynneth the Book of the Tales of Caunterbury.
Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,
And bathed every veyne in swich licour
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth
Inspired hath in every holt and heeth
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
Hath in the Ram his half cours yronne,
And smale foweles maken melodye,
That slepen al the nyght with open ye
(So priketh hem nature in hir corages),
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,
And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes,
To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes;
And specially from every shires ende
Of Engelond to Caunterbury they wende,
The hooly blisful martir for to seke,
That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke.

itself is open to the sky, the shrine laid bare to the heavens.  To the south

graciously lit by Minka.  The shop is stocked with all sorts of exotic goods
and wares manufactured from far and away places on Archipelago.  Of the many
items stocked here, you haven't the foggiest idea what they are, or do.  All

Lamman can bank their hard won crowns.  To ensure the safety of the wealth of
the citizenry, the King has posted two of his Royal Guard here.  A door on
the western wall, leads to the bank manager's office.  An open arched doorway

An Odd Room to be a Gaol~
   This strange little room seems out of place in the middle of the Lamman
city goal.  The walls are smooth and polished.  The floor is constructed from
sturdy planks.  Strangely, however, you feel as if you are being closely
watched.  Someone may be lurking here in the shadows.  The only way out of

come from exotic locales.  From distant lands they sail to Lamman conveying
valuable cargoes and information.  At the mouth of the bay, you see the Lamman
Lighthouse; it is there to safely guide these ships into port.  Harbour Road

a small polished map stone was embedded into the ground here.

The Parade Ground~
   A thick stone wall separates the parade ground from the palace gardens on
the other side.  The masoned stones of the wall were white-washed with lime a
long time ago, but has long since deteriorated with the passage of time. Lush
green ivy now grow on the wall, their spindly tendrils anchored in place into
minute cracks in the surface.%3  Looking closely, the cracks seem to form a
small archway, with the contour meandering around the sharp edges of stones.%

in its construction; which to no great surprise, is redwood.  The bridge spans
the River Ronnan just before it drains into the picturesque bay to the south.
You hear the cries of seagulls in the air and the shouts of rowdy dockworkers
unloading ships nearby.  The bridge extends east further across the river to
Market Square.  To the west, is the Quay.  A small rosewood hatch has been set
in the roadbed of the bridge.

the office of the harbour master, which is the place to negotiate passage on
a ship.  The Quay extends west from here.  You have never seen so many exotic
looking boats and people in one place.  The harbour area is notoriously rough,
the city watch usually maintains only a token presence to quell major riots.
To aid the one unfamiliar with this part of the city, a beautiful granite map
stone has been embedded into the ground here.  If you're wandering around here,
you had better watch your back, and not to get lost.  Lime street runs north
from here into the dwarven section of town.

Normally this would be an indication of lax security, however, here the locks
and bars are mental and enforced by the ample Corporal Carrot.  He'd rather
like it if someone tried to escape, as he would get to arrest them all over
again.

Durrin's Weapon Reapair Shop~
   Everyone knows that dwarves make the best blacksmiths, something to do with
surface area to volume ratios or some such thing.  To be sure, in Lamman the
blacksmiths are all dwarves.  No one is sure exactly how this came to be, but
some time ago a few trolls tried to set up a rival smithy in the heart of the
Troll Quarter.  Rumor has it there was an accident one night, and they were
found melted down in their own forge the next morning.
   Durrin can usually be found here in his shop.  As the official blacksmith
of Lamman, he turns a tidy profit repairing weapons and crafting arms for the
King.  When not too busy, he makes a bit of spare coin on the side repairing
weapons for adventurers.

Harbour Road~
   The aptly named Harbour Road runs alongside the busy harbour front.  As
you look south across the picturesque bay, you see ships of all sizes riding
at anchor in the calm waters.  To the west, you see the famous Red Bridge of
Lamman.  Harbour Road continues on to the east.

hangout of ruffneck sailors, thugs and spies, the Black Pig is the spiritual
home of the debauched and depraved.

looking characters hanging about in the lane, it would probably not be
prudent to venture in there alone or unprepared.  The Quay extends west and

The Storyteller's Circle~
      You are standing in the entrance to the Bard's Guild.  Until recently
The Bards Guild was retained exclusively by the King. Now, however, they 
are free to give lessons to one and all.

The Music Room~
      All around you, you can see musical instrument of all shapes and 
sizes.  The master bard is standing in the corner restringing an elderly
lute. He stares intently at the strings, seeming to caress them with his 
gaze. He doesn't seem to have noticed you, perhaps you should cough or
something.

The Great Western Road~
      This is the start of the Great Western Road. To the west lies the
West Gate of the City of Lamman and beyond that miles of desolate waste
land, a haven for bandits, pirates and criminals of every discription.
To the south lies the relative safety of the Lamman City Quay.

and run down than the other watch houses. To the north a road leads into
the troll ghetto.

The West Gate~
      You are standing at the west gate of the City of Lamman. To the
west the road extends into a bleak wilderness and it there are many
leagues of bandit infested territory between here and the next town.
The King would love to police the area, but it is just too big. So
beyond these gates you are on your own.

The Western Watch House~
      This watch house is not as big as the others, nor anywhere like
as tidy. This has a lot to do with who is in charge here, namely, Lance
Corporal Nobbs. Nobbs is not very houseproud, but at least the place is 
free of vermin, I wonder why?

Courtyard Lane~
   Your ears are filled with the resounding echoes of the clomping of horse
hooves and the stomping of adventurers' boots as you move along this narrow,
high-walled lane.  Contributing to the reverberations is the important
looking marble facade of the Royal Post Office of Lamman, the entrance to
which can be gained by going north.  Courtyard Lane continues to the east
toward the Market Square and west to the River Ronnan.

return north to the safety of the quay or continue on southward onto

A Gangplank~
   You are standing on a Gangplank.  Hopefully one day, a captain will be
found brave enough to risk his ship to sail across the ocean to the fabled
land of Zanzibar.  Unfortunately as of now, no captain has been persuaded
to take the dangerous voyage.  Maybe someday...  The only choice you have
is to return north, back to the quay.
