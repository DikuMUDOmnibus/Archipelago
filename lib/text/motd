NEW PLAYERS READ THIS:

I suggest that you check all the guilds before you learn/study or train
- just to see what skills are available to you. You can only practice warrior
skills in the warrior guild, thief skills in the thief guild, however some of
the guildmasters wander about town.

Avoid attacking any person with the words '(citizen)' it its title they will
call the guard on you and also tell other citizens - who will then become
hostile.
