ALIAS UNALIAS

   The command alias can be used to set a shortcut for a command. The format
is:
	alias <name> <command>

the text in <name> is then expanded to the full <command>. For example if you
set the alias:

	alias incinerate invoke 'pilum'

you could then use the command:

	incinerate evil_mob
or
	inciner evil_mob

etc. to cast the spell pilum on the mobile evil_mob.

   Note: You cannot replace existing commands with an alias as the aliases
are only checked after all legal commands have been checked.

   The command alias used with no arguments will list the aliases you have
defined. Currently there is a limit of 5 alias.  Once you have filled all 5
slots you will not be able to add any aliases.  If you want to remove an
alias you use the unalias command:

	unalias <name>

where name must match an existing alias.  This will free an alias slot.

#
MOUNT DISMOUNT MOUNTS

   Horses and various other mounts are available to the adventurer.  To get
atop your mount, you must MOUNT.  To get back on the ground, DISMOUNT.

#
HITCH UNHITCH

Usage: HITCH <item> <victim>
       UNHITCH <item>

   Use these commands to HITCH/UNHITCH pullable objects, like wagons,
to monsters, animals, and people.

#
TETHER UNTETHER

   Creatures, especially mounts, that are following you, can be tethered
in place to stop them from moving around with you.  They can be untethered
when you are ready to have them follow you around again.

#
SIZE SIZES

   Sizes will affect what you can and cannot wear, and what rooms you can or
cannot enter.  Luckily, most items can be resized to fit, just find a
craftperson who can resize the item, give it the item, and voila!, it will
be ready to wear.

..
<worn on head>  a helmet..in good condition.
<worn on body>  a breastplate..in poor condition.

>noconditions
>look self
..
<worn on head>  a helmet
<worn on body>  a breastplate

#
REPAIR

   Items that no longer perform as they should, are worn out, or broken, can
be fixed at a craftsperson.  Not all items can be fixed and resized by any
craftsperson, you have to find the right one who can do the type of work
you want done for the item.  There are armors, weapons, treasures, worn,
and other object types.

#
DRAW SHEATHE

   Cool commands... 'nuff said.   However, if you are really curious...  When
wearing a scabbard and a weapon, such as a sword, you can SHEATHE a wielded
sword.  This places the blade in the scabbard.  If you wish to fight something
or someone, DRAW your weapon.  By doing so, you will instantly wield your
weapon.  Also, if you are jumped by an aggressive monster or person, you will
automatically draw your weapon and begin to fight. Note: these two commands
only work if you are wearing or carrying a scabbard.

#
MOTD

Use this command to display the message of the day.  Immortals who want to
read the mortal motd (instead of their own message), type 'motd mortal'.

#
ABORT

   Abort will clear the input buffer of all pending commands.  You will still
be subject to any spell/command delays from the command currently being
processed.

#
DONATION

   There are several donation shops in the game.  Martha in Lamman (1n2e1n
from the fountain), Aelfric in Abernach, and Reimund in Wivernhoe.  When an
item is donated it randomly goes to one of these shops.  There is a small
chance that an item will get junked when it is donated.  Money donated goes
to the poor box just inside the Temple of Small Gods in Lamman.

See also: DONATE
#
LOOK

Usage: LOOK [ <keyword> | at | <dir> | in | out | at | me/self | room ]

o LOOK without any options will redisplay the room, its name, description,
  exits, and whoever and whatever is in the room, as if you are entering it
  for the first time.  Note: if you are using BRIEF descriptions, you will
  only see the room's name, exits, and any beings of objects in the room.

o The <keyword> option is used to look at something/someone in the room.  It
  can also be used to look at something specific that was mentioned in the
  room's description.  Many rooms have secret keywords embedded into the text,
  and are often clues that can safe your life, hints to where a treasure is
  buried, or simply there to enrich your role playing adventures.

o The 'at' option is not necessary, simply omitting it while looking at
  something will work just the same.

o The <dir> option is used to look in a specific direction.  This option may
  yield important hints/clues about nearby rooms, if available.

o The 'in' option looks into a container and displays its contents.  In the
  case of container exits, 'LOOK IN <object>' will show the room the container
  links to.  Container exits can be entered, and things can be placed into the
  room simply by putting stuff into the container.

o The 'out' option is used to look out of a room you are in.  The 'out' option
  works only if there is a 'leave' exit available.  If none is available, the
  first exit leading outdoors will be used instead.

o The 'me' or 'self' option looks at yourself, displays what equipment you
  have on, and your character's description.

Notes:

o If you LOOK AT CORPSE you will not see its inventory.  To see what is inside
  a container (i.e. a corpse) use LOOK IN <OBJECT>.

o To view messages on a bulletin board, you need to LOOK BOARD.  You need to
  be actually in the same room as a bulletin board for this to work. To read a
  message, you can READ <message number>.

AC ARMOUR ARMOR

   ``AC'' is your Armour Class.  It is a number from -100 to 100, roughly
defined as follows:

  100 Buck-naked person
    0 Heavily armoured
 -100 Armored battle tank

See also: STOPPING
#
STOPPING

   ``STOPPING'' is the ability of your armour to absorb damage.  It is a
number (usually small) and corresponds to the maximum amount of damage from a
blow that can be absorbed by your armour.

See also: ARMOUR
#
LOCK UNLOCK

Usage: LOCK/UNLOCK [ <portal/container> | <dir> ]

   To keep things such as doors and chests secure from thievery, they are
locked.  In fact, any number of portals and containers can be locked.  Even
things such as rings, tables, and desks can be locked.  To open locked portals
and containers, you will either need the proper key or be able to picklock.
Some locks, however, unpickable and can only be opened with the right key.

Examples:

> lock door
> unlock door south

> lock chest
> unlock chest

See also: OPEN, CLOSE
#
OPEN CLOSE

Usage: OPEN/CLOSE [ <portal/container> | <dir> ]

   Often it is necessary to open things such as doors and chests to discover
their contents.  Equally as common is the need to close doors and chests to
prevent monsters and demons from escaping rooms and containers.

Examples:

> open portal
> close gate

> open chest
> close box

See also: LOCK, UNLOCK
#
NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN
To move in a given direction.

These commands may also be abbreviated: n s e w u d

See also: MOUNTS
#
TASTE EAT

Usage: TASTE/EAT [ <food> ]

   After many hours of exploring, you will become hungry.  When hungry, you
will recover hit points and movement points at a vastly slower rate.  It is,
therefore, a good strategy to EAT food.  Some foods might be poisonous, so to
be on the safe side, TASTE a food before you eat it.

See also: SIP, DRINK
#
SIP DRINK

Usage: SIP/DRINK [ <liquid> ]

SIP DRINK

Usage: SIP/DRINK [ <liquid> ]

   After many hours of exploring, you will become thirsty.  When thirsty, you
will recover hit points and movement points at a vastly slower rate.  It is,
therefore, a good strategy to DRINK liquids.  Some liquids might be poisonous,
so to be on the safe side, SIP a liquid before you drink it.

See also: TASTE, EAT
#
WHO

Usage: WHO [ <minlev>-<maxlev> | -d | -n <keyword> | -s | -o | -q | -r | -z ]


   Lists the people currently in the game.  Some people may be invisible.
Command-line options can be used to limit the listing.  The parameters can be
specified on the command-line in any order.

Flags:
  minlev-maxlev : Lists only people whose level is at or above minlev, and
                  optionally, at or below maxlev.

  -d : lists only people who are link dead.
  -n : lists only people whose names or titles contain <keyword>.
  -s : lists names in the short form (4 columns of names, without titles or
       flags).
  -o : lists only outlaws (i.e. people with a killer or thief flag).
  -q : lists only people who are on the Quest.
  -r : lists only people who are in your current room.
  -z : lists only people in your current zone.

Examples:

> who 15-25 -o -z
        Lists all outlaws between levels 15 and 25 who are in your zone.
> who -d -s
      Lists all linkdead players in short form.

See also: TITLE, FLAGS
#
SAVE
   Save your persona.  This includes experience points, hit points, coins,
et cetera.  Your equipment is also saved in the unlikely event of a crash.
Archipelago periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not
necessary to have your client auto-save you as well.
   You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.
   Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an inn to store your belongings.

** For immortals the 'save' command also saves your relevant area files **

See also: INN, RENT

#
TITLE

   The TITLE command sets the title others will see when they walk into a room
and on the WHO list.  Parentheses (the '(' and ')' characters) are reserved
for flags and consequently unavailable for use in titles.  The minimum
requirement for your title is your name, which is represented by %n.
   Titles on Archipelago are more flexible than can be found on most other
muds.  Immortals of Daemon and greater can set titles to exclude the %n (name)
of the person from their title.  So beware, some people may not be who they
seem to be.

Title %Codes:
   %n  name (required to be in your title string)<
   %c  race
   %l  a level dependent keyword
   %o  opponent (the opponent your are fighting)
   %r  room (the room in which your are currently in)

   Colour codes can also be placed into your title using Archipelago's ANSI
colour %codes.

Examples (all for player elf Wiglaf):

> title %n of Wivernhoe the %l %o slayer.

When not in combat: Wiglaf of Wivernhoe the wily nobody slayer.
When in combat with orcs: Wiglaf of Wivernhoe the wily orc slayer.

                        DO NOT ABUSE THE TITLE COMMAND.
              IF YOU DO, YOUR TITLE PRIVILEGE WILL BE REVOKED.

See also: FLAGS, COLOUR, ANSI
#
FLAGS

   Players sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

FLAG        MEANING
----------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
(KILLER)    Player is trying to kill other players.  That means you
            can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
(THIEF)     Player is trying to steal from other players.  Fire away.
(invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are

(quest)     Player is participating in a quest currently being run by
            the Immortals.
(away)      Immortals may set this using the brb command - it means they are
            either really away or busy - so don't bug 'em.

#
GIVE

Usage: GIVE [ <quantity> | <coins> | <(modifier)object> | <victim> ]

#
WEAR

Usage: WEAR [ <modifier> | <object> | <location> ]

   If you want to wear some clothes, armour, or the likes, simply wear them.
Also, to wear everything in your inventory (or at least try to, as wearing
things like loaves of bread is not a good way to win friends and influence
people) you can type 'wear all'.
   Optionally, you can specify where on your body to wear the equipment.

> wear boots
> wear all.bronze
> wear all

#
KILL HIT

   A good way to start a fight.  Not a good idea to hit other players.
#
INVOKE

   For ``magical'' people. If you want to direct a spell at someone or
something.

Example : invoke 'blade of shivering ice' <player>
   Note that the name of the spell must be enclosed by "'" s.

There are three modifiers that can be used with the invoke command:
-novoice -nogesture -ve

-novoice     means you will not be seen to utter the spell
-nogesture   means you will not make gestures when casting
-vis         means you will use any appropriate raw Vis objects 
             you happen to be wearing.

   Each of the first two options adds to the difficulty of casting the spell.
If you are underwater and not able to breath water you will automatically
cast spells with -novoice and incur the penalty.  Similarly if for any
reason you cannot speak - e.g. you have something in your mouth they you again
incur the -novoice penalty.  See the help on VIS for more information about
raw vis objects.
   If you are underwater and do not have 'free action' then you will
automatically cast with -nogesture and incur the casting penalty.  The same
is true if you try to cast whilst holding something or wielding a two-handed
weapon  or wielding two weapons - i.e. you must have at least 1 hand free to
cast without the -nogesture penalty.
   There will be times when casting without these option could cause you to be
attacked.

#
SPELLS MAGIC

   Magic in this world is powerful, diverse and useful.  Anyone with the
necessary knowledge can, with modest success, produce a simple cantrip.
However, to truly excel as a magus with a calling in the arcane arts requires
dedication and a vast reservoir of time, something not everyone can afford.
   There are fifteen magical arts divided into five Techniques and ten Forms
that, along with Magical Theory, form the arcane body of knowledge we refer
to as magic.
   Spells are composed of formulas combining a Technique and a Form.  These
combinations are merely classificatory, and not used to invoke the spell
itself, e.g., the 'bind wounds' spell is 'creo corpus' magic.  Virtually
any spell, both known and unknown to the magus, can be invoked as follows:

     INVOKE -nogesture -novoice -vis '<spell>' <target>

   The -nogesture and -novoice are optional.  Its use in spell casting will
increase the cost of the spell, where cost is the chance of botching
   Spells will incur no penalty to the magus if successfully cast.  If spell
casting is botched, loss of movement points, and other harmful side effects
can occur.  A botched spell will sometimes offer the magus new insight and
improved magical ability toward future spell casting.  Extremely fatigued
magicians, often requiring sleep and prolonged rest, will not be able to
invoke spells until suitably recovered.
   There are two conditions to successful spell casting: studying and casting.

Studying:
   One's stats in Int, Wis, Foc and proficiencies in Magic Theory, Techniques
and Forms determine what spells you can, or are allowed to study.  The higher
your stats and proficiencies, the higher the spell level you can study at.
   So, as an example, if you have a high creo (a tech), a high ignem (a form),
and a low corpus (a form), all it means is that you can study higher level
'creo ignem' spells than possible with 'creo corpus'.

Casting:
   The more proficiency you have in a spell, the less chance of botching
will occur when the spell invoked.  Your Int, Wis, and Foc stats also affect
spell casting and concentration.

See also: INVOKE, LEARN, STUDY, TECHNIQUE, FORM, VIS
#
VIS

   Raw Vis objects are basically raw magic stored in an object.  Like spells
the Raw Vis can have flavours e.g. Creo Ignem, or just Creo, or just Ignem.
Creo Ignem Vis can only be used for casting Creo Ignem spells, but Creo Vis
can be used to aid casting any Creo spell and similarly for Ignem Vis.

   The amount of Raw Vis contained in an object is measured in pawns.  Each
pawn of raw vis used in casting a spell adds 5 to the casting total and 1 to
the number of botch dies.  The maximum amount of Raw Vis a player can control
it determined by the VIM form skill of the player.

   All Raw Vis itmes that a player is wearing when they invoke with the -vis
option will be used regardless of whether the player can use all the Raw Vis.
The surplus is wasted - except that the number of botch dies is increased by
the total number of pawns expended not by the total the player could use.

   Once a Raw Vis object has been used it is destroyed.

#
JUNK

Usage: JUNK [ <quantity> | <coins> | <(modifier)object> ]

   By junking an object, you destroy the object permanently thus keeping the
world tidy.  If you JUNK something, it will disappear and you'll get a few
pennies.  To junk all your equipment go to to a dump, the nearest dump is
located in the compost heap in the Palace Gardens off the east side of Lamman.

Examples:

> junk 10 crown         (You junk ten crowns.)
> junk 3.sword          (You junk your third sword.)
> junk 2*cantrip        (You junk two cantrips.)
> junk all.shield       (You junk all your shields.)

See also: DROP, DONATE, MODIFIERS
#
DONATE

Usage: DONATE [ <quantity> | <coins> | <(modifier)object> ]

   This command takes an object that you no longer want and deposits it in the
donation shop in either Lamman, Abernach or Wivernhoe, to assist newbies in
getting started.  There is a small chance that an item will get junked when it
is donated.  Money donated goes to the poor box just inside the Temple of
Small Gods in Lamman.

Examples:

> donate 10 crown        (You donate ten crowns.)
> donate 3.sword         (You donate your third sword.)
> donate 2*cantrip       (You donate two cantrips.)
> donate all.shield      (You donate all your shields.)

See also: JUNK, DONATION, MODIFIERS
#
DROP


Usage: DROP [ <quantity> | <coins> | <(modifier)object> ]

   If you lose interest in a carried item, you can drop it on the ground.  If
you are wearing the item, you must REMOVE it first before dropping it.

Examples:

> drop 10 crown        (You drop ten crowns on the ground.)
> drop 3.sword         (You drop your third sword on the ground.)
> drop 2*cantrip       (You drop two cantrips on the ground.)
> drop all.shield      (You drop all your shields on the ground.)
> drop all             (You drop everything in your inventory.)

SHOPS

   Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armour, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

LEARN

Usage: LEARN [number_of_levels] <skill name>

   Learn is the way you improve your skills. You must go to a guildmaster to
let him/her help you improve. If you type learn, you will see which skills

#
EXITS

   Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course, the
less obvious ones (such as secret doors) won't show up here - you have to
THINK in order to locate those.

#
LEAVE

   If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the nearest
obvious exit to the outside.

#
ENTER

   If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you'll enter any nearby shelter.
You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for example, 'enter window'.
   You may also enter certain containers or exits.

#
TIME

   Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll have
to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this particular
notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.

#
BUG TYPO IDEA

Usage: [ <bug | typo | idea> <text> ]

   For making useful and helpful suggestions to the implementors.

Examples:

> idea make a restaurant in Lamman
> typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'

#

you'll have to find an inn and pay rent.
   NOTE: YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR STUFF WHEN YOU TYPE QUIT!!!

See also: INN, RENT
#
GET TAKE

to type in your note at the keyboard.

#
WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND

   Scan will attempt to show you the creature in the surrounding area. It is
not perfect however and its efficiency drops off with distance - so you
might miss some creatures.

#
FLEE

   If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a bit uncomfortable
(maybe your are dying), just type 'flee', and presto! you are out of harm's
way - that is, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit doesn't
simply bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, who wants to live forever?
   Flee will clear all pending commands in the input buffer.  You will still
be subject to any spell/command delays from the command being processed.

#
GUILD

   The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building.  Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade.

See also: PRACTICE
#
WHERE

Usage: WHERE <keyword.one> <keyword.two>

   Tells you the location of a mobs, a player or an object.  Mortals can only
WHERE to find what other players are currently in the zone they are in,
   Immortals may type WHERE without arguments to see where everybody is.

Examples:
> WHERE                    (Shows where all the players are located.)

The following only work for immortals:
> WHERE torch              (Shows where all the torches are located.)
> WHERE iron sword         (Shows where all the iron swords are located.)
> WHERE dragon             (Shows where all the dragons are located.)

#
LEVELS

LEVEL LEVELS

Usage: LEVEL <min_level> <max_level>

   There are 200 mortal and 7 immortal levels available on Archipelago.  In
order of rank from lowest to highest, the immortal levels are Avatar, Builder,
Bodhisattva, Daemon, Djinn, Overlord, and Implementor.
   When a mortal reaches the 200th level, he or she becomes a lesser Avatar.

Example:
>level 3 6

[  3]      3000-6000      :
[  4]      6000-12000     :
[  5]     12000-25000     :
[  6]     25000-45000     :

#
NOREPEAT

   This command toggles whether or not you see your communication echoed back
to you (i.e., from commands such as SAY, SHOUT, HOLLER, GOSSIP, etc.)  Useful
if you have a slow connection or if it just annoys you.

#
BRIEF

   Toggle ``brief mode;;.  When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions
of the room you are in; only the name of the room, the exits, and the beings
and objects there.
   While on Archipelago, it is not recommended to ever toggle on the ``brief
mode.''  Builders here often change the rooms and areas after they become over
explored and stale.  So unless you are very familiar with the area in which
you are traveling, however even then, it is not advisable to use this command.
   Frequently, you will find small but vital hints in the descriptions of the
rooms: An extra peek at your surroundings could mean the difference between
life and death!

See also: COMPACT
#
! ^

   Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.  This is useful for
repeated bashes or invoking spells.
   Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement".

Examples:

> tell mycrof Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.
 
> ^mycrof^mycroft
You tell Mycroft, 'Hi there, how are you?'
 
> ^you^you doing^
You tell Mycroft, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

#
CONSIDER

Usage: consider <monster>

   This command will compare your level with the <monsters> level.  You will
then receive a rough estimate, which is by no means exact.  Consider does not
take hitpoints/special attacks/damage into account.  This is a slightly flawed
command, so use it with a grain of salt.

> consider zinkozoover

#
EXPERIENCE XP

   Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.  Things you should
know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

See Also: GROUP
#
GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]
        GROUP all

   GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <person>
adds or removes (person) from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.
   If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of the
killing blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.
   Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.
   To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should NOT
follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for each
person in the group, by using "group <person_name>". The leader should
remember to include himself in the group.

Example:
Ratatosk and Saladin wishes to group with Ansalon.

Ratatosk: follow ansalon
Saladin : follow ansalon
  (Ansalon should be following no one but himself)
Ansalon : group all

Later when Ansalon becomes upset at Ratatosk (because he is eating acorns all
the time) he types: GROUP RATATOSK to kick Ratatosk out of the group.

See Also: XP, EXPERIENCE, UNGROUP
#
UNGROUP

   UNGROUP can be used by group leaders to disband the entire group, or to
kick a specific group member out of the group (and stop him/her from following
the leader).

#
BEHEAD

   Behead is a skill taught by the Warrior Guild.  Basically it teaches you to
notice opportunities in combat where you can sever your opponent head killing
him instantly.  Beheading is only possible using cleaving and slashing weapons.

#
CLIMB CLIMBING

   Climbing is a skill taught by the thief guild and it will enable you to
attempt to climb into places you otherwise may not go.  To easily learn the
climbing skill you should have good dexterity, good strength and good focus.
   Your success in attempting a given climb will depend on the severity of the
climb, how much weight you are carrying, your strength, your focus and your
climb skill.
   As a guide a person with max dexterity, strength, focus  and climb skill
would be able to climb a 'severe' climb 100% of the time as long as they did
not have a weight exceeding 250 lbs - including their personal weight and
items carried.  So if the pc weighed 150 lbs they would succeed 100% of the
time whilst carrying under 100 lbs of stuff.  'Severe' is the second highest
rating of climb.
   Climbing requirement is negated by flight.

#
RECITE SCROLL SCROLLS

Usage: RECITE <scroll> [Target]

   Is used to "read" a magical scroll. Target can be an object, character or
nothing (which may be yourself).
#
USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Usage: Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

   Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.
   Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.
   Wands, staffs and rods all have a down time between uses during which
they may not be used.

BANK WITHDRAW DEPOSIT BALANCE

   Money has physical weight, the more money you carry, the more it will
weight you down.  Banks help alleviate this problem by storing your money for
you.  Not only can banks store money, but also equipment in a safe deposit
box for a small surcharge.  It is useful to keep at least a sword stored in
the bank for emergencies.
   There are known to be banks located in Lamman, Abernach, and Wivernhoe.
You can DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, as well as check your BALANCE at a bank.  These are
the commands to put money in the bank, take money out of the bank, or see how
much money you have in the bank.

> deposit 1 crown
> withdraw 2 groat
> balance
#
WIMP WIMPY

   Use the WIMP command to automatically wimp out of a fight.

See also: TOGGLE
#
REPEAT

   Use REPEAT to control whether or not the mud echoes your communication
commands to you (i.e. the MUD will tell you what you just said, group-said,
shouted, or told someone).  This is useful to verify what you just said, but
can be annoying if you have a slow link.

See also:  SAY GSAY TELL SHOUT
#
TOGGLE

   TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on
Archipelago.  This command CAN NOT be used to change these values (see related
commands.)  All of these toggles remain the same until you change them; i.e.
they are saved when you quit or rent.

See Also:  DISPLAY BRIEF COMPACT NOTELL NOSHOUT  QUEST REPEAT WIMP
#
SPLIT

Usage:  SPLIT <amount to split>

SPLIT is used to split money among people in your group who are in the same
room as you.  If you are in a group with 4 other people, all of whom are in
the same room with you, and you type SPLIT 100, you will give each of the
other 4 group members 20 coins each.  (100 coins is split 5 ways; you keep
your share and give everyone else their share).

Examples:
>get all corpse
You get a pile of gold, silver and copper coins from the corpse of a hemogoblin.
There were 12 crown, 8 groats and 4 pennies.

>split 1284
You split 12 crowns, 8 groats and 4 pennies among 1 members;
  3 crowns, 2 groats and 1 penny each.

communicate with you.  (notell) will appear after your name in the WHO
list if you have notell on.

See also: FLAGS TELL WHO TOGGLE
#
LINK

   Many people mudding from North America have problems with their links to
Archipelago.  As most of the immortal staff on Archipelago is from the States,
we sympathize greatly with this problem.  Poor or slow links an be not only
irksome when holding a conversation, but also very hazardous to your health
in the middle of a battle, of course.

 * If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each time
   someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you will be
   saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you reconnect to
   the game.

 * If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
   can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By breaking
   the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

 * Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
   reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully cut your
   link.

#
COMPACT

   This command is one of the most useful on Archipelago for reducing spam.
Not only does it toggles the extra blank line output to your screen after each
command, which is useful if you have a small display.  But even better, with
compact on, ALL misses in combat will be masked from your display.

See also: BRIEF
#
VISIBLE

   Use this command to break your spell of invisibility before it expires.
#
EMOTE :

   Show people what you're feeling.  The shorthand is ":".

> check

To ask the Postmaster to give you your mail, if you have any waiting:
> receive

#
SAY TELL WHISPER SHOUT YELL

   If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

<say | shout > <string>
<tell | whisper | ask> <player> <string>

> say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
> tell uncle hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in: ' hello there.

   Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.  Yell
broadcasts to everyone in the game but costs 20 movement points.  You must
be level 2 before you can use shout and yell.

   If you cannot see the person who 'tells' to you you can use the command
respond this will tell back to the last person to tell to you.

See also: GOSSIP AUCTION GSAY NOREPEAT QSAY RESPOND
#
RESPOND

#
INN INNS RECEPTION

   When you feel tired and want to leave the Archipelago, find an inn or a
similar place to RENT.  This insures that your equipment will be stored away
safely, and made available when you return to the Archipelago.  Renting will
usually cost something depending on the quality of your equipment.  At the
innkeeper, type OFFER to see how much this cost will be, and note the number
of days you can rent with the gold you are carrying on hand and deposited in
the banks.
   If you run out of money while rented, money will be taken out of your bank
account, and when that runs out, items from your inventory will be seized to
cover the cost of your rent (items will be seized when you come out of rent,
and not before).
   Characters that have been link-dead for a while will be eventually be
force-rented at a higher surcharge than it normally costs to rent.

See also: OFFER RENT
#
OFFER RENT

   For use in the receptions of inns.  Offer makes the innkeeper tell you the
cost of storing your belongings for one day.  Rent stores you belongings and

   If you have a colour-capable terminal and wish to see useful colour-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of colouring you see.

> color off
This command disables all colour.

> color sparse
> color normal
> color complete

   These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.
   Using colour will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY
slightly.  The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you
have colour turned on, non-colourized messages will not be slowed down at all.

#
NEWBIE

   Welcome to Archipelago!  You have chosen a wondrous realm to explore full
of high adventure, great comradeship, and fantastic treasure.  Before you
venture forth into the lands, there are a few tips and tricks you should know
to make your hard life here a wee bit easier.
   First, give yourself a title by typing 'title %n the great!'.  The %n in
the title is your name and is necessary.  Other %codes includable in your new
title are: %r (room name you are in); %c (your race); %l (your level); and
%o (the opponent you are fighting).  You can also add colour to your title to
give it that special pizzazz.
   Second, although the Gods are generally stingy and not given to bouts of
gift giving, they recognize that you are new on the Archipelago and have
granted you some equipment.  Type 'i' (inventory), and 'eq' (equipment), to
see what has been bestowed upon you.  Your equipment has been resized to
personally fit you.  If you notice, there is a sword nestled in a scabbard.
To use that weapon, type 'draw'.  To sheathe it, type 'sheathe'.
   Third, if at some time during your stay here you grow hungry, the Gods
mercifully have given you two loaves of coarse wheat bread.  To eat this meal,
type 'eat bread'. If you become thirsty, there are fountains and rivers filled
with water throughout the lands.
<p>
   Fourth, after leveling you should visit the various guilds and wandering
guildmasters to obtain new skills, spells, and weapon proficiencies.  At the
guildmaster, type 'learn' (for skills), 'study' (for spells), and 'train'
(for weapons).  When you wish to know something, type '(learn|study|train)
(# of levels) (desired knowledge)'.  As an example, to learn four levels of
magic theory, type `learn 4 magic'.  The difficulty, or ease, in learning
skills, spells and weapons is determined by your ability statistics.
   Fifth, you will need a place to rent when you are tired.  The nearest inn
is the Warrior's Widow.  The receptionist can be found 2 west, 1 north, and
1 up from the fountain.
   Sixth, you will probably want to start gaining experience.  The best way
to do this is to start slowly at first.  Try taking on the various bugs and
other small critters that surround the fountain.  Creatures such as beetles,
doodlebugs, ants, zinkozoovers, slimy slitherers, warty toads, magpies, and
sparrows all make excellent fodder for your sword.  Do not attack citizens,
unless you want to die real fast.
   Best of luck!  Please feel free to ask for help, and do not feel shy in
directing any comments, complaints, or suggestions you may have on the
various boards about town.  To write on a board type `write (name of topic)'.

"GETTING STARTED" STARTING

  This entry is for people who are familiar with muds but are just starting
here at Archipelago.  People who are new to mudding should read 'help NEWBIE'
before proceeding.  There are many differences between Archipelago and most
other muds.
   This mud is more skill oriented than class oriented in that you can learn
any spell or skill that you wish as long as you have enough practice points.
Also new players should check out and train their weapon proficiencies in
their weapon of choice.  We are currently using some ideas from 'Ars Magica'
so you may not realize what they do unless you use the spell or skill but you
should recognize the affects.

ELF ELVES
   Nature loving, mischievous and generally frivolous, elves enjoy living out
of doors. They have few permanent settlements preferring to live a quasi nomadic
life. Where elves have settled in large numbers their housing is simple and
made to be easily disassembled and moved. They tend to favour woodland
locations and almost never build any fortifications.

standing.  The first argument can be a virtual room number or the name of a
character or object.  The remainder of the line is passed to the command
interpreter.

> at 3001 look
> at fido kill fido
> at 3.corpse get all corpse

See also: GOTO
#
BAN UNBAN

   These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game. You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site. Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

ban [<'ALL' | 'NEW' | 'SELECT'> <site>]
unban <site>

> ban new ai.mit.edu
> unban ai.mit.edu
#
DATE

   Shows the current real time.
#
DC

dc <descriptor number>

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket.  If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.

#
ECHO GECHO SEND

echo <message>
gecho <message>
send <victim> <message>

ECHO displays a string to everyone in your room.  GECHO displays the string
to everyone in the game.  SEND displays the string to a particular person.

> echo Hi, everyone in the room.
> gecho Hi, everyone in the game, isn't this annoying?
> send ponder You are being watched.
#
FORCE

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

> force fido drop meat
> force all save
> force room look fido
#
FREEZE THAW

FREEZE, originally invented here at Archipelago (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

See also: SET FROZEN
#
GOTO TRANS WIZTELEPORT

go to <location>
trans <victim>
teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

> go to 3001
> go to ponder
> trans fido
> teleport fido 3001
> teleport fido 2.fido

people at and above the level you specify will be able to see you.

> invis
> invis 31
#
LAST

last <player_name>

For checking the last time a person logged on, their sitename, and their
ID number.

#
NOHASSLE

Toggles a flag to prevent aggressive monsters from attacking.
#
NOTITLE

NOTITLE is used to prevent players from being able to set their own titles;
i.e., if the player consistently has an offensive title.  The definition of
offensive is left as an exercise for the reader.
#
NOWIZ

Allows you to hear or ignore messages coming over the wizline.

See also: WIZNET
#
PAGE

page <player|'all'> <message>

PAGE is used to send a message, along with a beep, to another player.  Use
PAGE ALL to send a message and a beep to everyone in the game.

Do not abuse this command.
#
PARDON

Removes killer and thief flags from a player.
#
POOFIN POOFOUT

Sets the message seen by players when you use GOTO to move to a different
room.  POOFIN with no argument resets your poofin to the default "appears with
an ear-splitting bang"; POOFOUT with no argument defaults to "disappears in
a puff of smoke."

See also: GOTO
#
PURGE

purge [name]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

> purge
> purge <character>
> purge <object>

See also: DC
#
REBOOT

reboot <'*'|file>

REBOOT is used to load text files such as the MOTD from disk into memory.
REBOOT * reads all text files.  Valid files are:

#
REROLL

reroll <player>

REROLL gives a player new stats (i.e., str, int, wis, dex, and con.)
#
RESTORE

RESTORE restores a player or mobile to full hit, mana, and move points.  If
used on immortals, it sets all skill levels to 100%.
#
RETURN

RETURN returns you to your regular body if you are switched.

See also: SWITCH
#
ROOMFLAGS

Toggles a flag which causes the virtual room number and room flags, if any,
to be displayed next to room names.
#
SET

set [file|player] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with lame names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields, the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

Look at do_set in act.wizard.c for a list of valid set fields.

See also: STAT
#
SHOW

show <mode> [argument]

The SHOW command displays information.  Some modes of show require additional
information, such as a player name.  Show without any arguments shows a list
of valid modes.

#
SHUTDOWN

shutdown [reboot|die|pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.
DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.
PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.
#
SLOWNS

Toggles the namserver_is_slow setting.  See circle/src/config.c for
more information.
#
SNOOP

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command;
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> to stop snooping.
#
SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.
#
STAT

STAT [player|object|mobile|file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people with lame
names such as Red or Cityguard.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the playerfile.

> stat fido
> stat player red
> stat mobile red
> stat file ponder
> stat object thunderbolt

and hostname.

The following switches are available:

-k or -o   Show only outlaws (killers and thieves)
