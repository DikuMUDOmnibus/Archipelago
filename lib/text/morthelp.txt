FLAGS

Players sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

FLAG        MEANING
----------- ---------------------------------------------------------
(KILLER)    Player is trying to kill other players.  That means you
	    can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
(THIEF)     Player is trying to steal from other players.  Fire away.
(invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are
	    sensitive to the presence of invisible things.
(writing)   Player is writing on the board; do not disturb.
(mailing)   Player is writing mail; do not disturb.
(deaf)	    Player has chosen not to hear shouts.

#
SAVE
Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

** For immortals the 'save' command also saves your relevant area files **

> save

SHOPS
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

#
COMMANDS

A canonical list of all the known verbs.

> commands
#
PRACTICE PRACTISE

practice #sessions <skill name>

Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go to
your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve.
If you type practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and
how good you already are at these.
You can then use practice # <skill>, to practice the appropriate skill, where
# is the number of practice sessions you wish to expend on the skill.
Each skill has a mimimum level which depend on your stats and a difficulty
which also depends on your stats. The maximum level to which you can learn
the skill also depends on your stats. A difficulty 1 skill/spell takes
1 practice session per percentage point of proficiency gained. To practice
a difficulty 3 spell/skill to 78% proficiency therefore required 234 practice
sessions etc..

See also: GAIN
#
GAIN

If you recieve the message that you have gained enough experience to advance
a level you may proceed to a guild and type gain. Each time you "gain" you
will gain an experience level, hit points movement points mana etc and also
practice sessions. With each level you advance there is a possibility that
you can learn new skills. You should check all the guilds and see what new
spells/skills you can learn by typing "practice" in the presence of the
guildmaster.

#
ENTER

TIME

this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#

small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

See Also: GROUP
#
GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]
        GROUP all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of wherther the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

room, execpt yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be eihter a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the

them to Bad Places, all characters now have SUMMON PROTECTION turned on by
default.  This prevents people from summoning you and gives you a warning
message if someone tries.  If you want to let someone summon you (i.e. if

back on.

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION
Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

group.  You can use this command to let potential rescuers know how

DIAGNOSE

fighting someone, you can use DIAGNOSE with no arguments to diagnose the
person you're fighting.

#
CLEAR CLS

Clears the screen on many terminals.
#
ANSI "COLOR"

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

> color off
This command disables all color.

> color sparse
> color normal
> color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

NEWBIE
If you are just starting playing MUDS we request that your read the help on 
the topics listed when you type the command 'help' by itself.  Most players 
are usually more than happy to help you out with things not mentioned in the
help file so feel free to ask for help.  One word of advice, most people
will not respond favorably to people being rude or obnoxious.  The immortals
here will help as much as possible when convenient but remember they have 
rules to what they can and cannot do in regards to interaction with players.
If you feel you have suggestions to better the mud feel free to use the IDEA
command.  Also the BUG and TYPO commands can be used when you think you have
found a mistake.  You can also use the bulletin boards to make suggestions
about the game.

"GETTING STARTED" STARTING
This entry is for people who are familiar with muds but are just starting here
at Archipeligo.  People who are new to mudding should read 'help NEWBIE' before
proceeding.  There are many differences between archipeligo and most other muds.
This mud is more skill oriented than class oriented in that you can learn any
spell or skill that you wish as long as you have enough practice points.  Also
new players should check out and practice their proficiencies in there weapon 
of choice.  Players can use the QUESTION and ASK skills to find out certain 
information from the NPCs that wander the MUD.  We are currently planning on
using some ideas from 'Ars Magica' so you may not realize what they do unless
you use the spell or skill but you should recognize the affects.
