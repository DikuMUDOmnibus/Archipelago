 Archipelago is a based on the CircleMUD 2.2 code (see below). The major
 modifications by Alastair Neil (Ponder) at The University of Essex Dept.
 of Psychology, Soraya Ghiasi (Kalliste) at The University of
 Colorado, Boulder and Shawn L. Baird (Scarrow). Angus Hamilton (Arg)  has
 also been a source of ideas and a good critical filter.

 Many individuals have dedicated thousands of hours in contributing in  
 building the world of Archipelago and contributing to the development
 and philosophy of the game. Notable are:

 Chuck Blomberg (Saladin)
 Jason Chayes (Ansalon) 
 Robert Chin (Xero)
 David Czeck (Magnifico)
 Sandra Miura (Grace)
 Bryan Wride (Ratatosk)

 CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
 Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
 to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
 Hopkins University.

 Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
 the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
 them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to (in alphabetical order):
 Danny Baker, Bill Bogstad, Harold Ervin, Fenris, Jeff Fink, Furey, Gnort,
 Sharon Goza, Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Jay Levino, Fred Merkel, Catherine
 Stanton, Naved Surve, and Tim Stearns.  Circle would be different in some
 way without the contributions of any of these people.

 CircleMUD is available for anonymous FTP at ftp.cs.jhu.edu in pub/CircleMUD.
 Its author can be contacted at jelson@cs.jhu.edu.
