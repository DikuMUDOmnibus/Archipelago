ARMOR/ARMOUR

   Armour should be consistent with its description, meaning an item such as
a cloth shirt is not expected to be good armor, therefore it shouldn't be.
Similarly, a tempered meteoric steel breast plate sounds rather impressive
and should be.

   general type          AC/stop     weight(lbs)    weight (mud weight unit)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   cloth:              1-10/0          1-15 lbs     10-150 mwu
   leather/fur:       11-20/1         16-30 lbs    160-300 mwu
   mail:              21-30/2         31-40 lbs    310-400 mwu
   plate:             31-40/3         41-50 lbs    410-500 mwu

   No armour class location should have more than 35-40 armour class
adjustment by any one item.  Also, no armour class location should have
more than +3 stopping from any single item.  If an item affects multiple
areas, the total armour class modification should not exceed 60 and the
total stopping should not exceed +6.
   Equipment locations like ears, mouth, and eyes should in general not
modify armour class in anyway.  These should be considered as locations for
jewelry and other accessories.

WEAPON/WEAPONS

SWORDS         OTHER WEAPON         MISSILE             WEIGHT RANGE  MAX DMG
pixie sword    dagger/knife         sling                up to 8 lbs    10
short sword    axe                  short bow               8-16 lbs    15
long sword     hammer/club          light crossbow         16-24 lbs    20
broad sword    mace                 long bow/heavy Xbow    20-30 lbs    25
2H sword       2h weapons/polearms  catapult/trebuchet     30-60 lbs    35

Note: The maximum damage clearly corresponds to weapons at the upper end of
      the weight range.

No weapon should receive more than +6 total bonuses in +hit and +damage.
Examples:  +5 hit and +1 damage
           +4 hit and +2 damage
           +3 hit and +3 damage
           +2 hit and +3 damage
           +1 hit and +5 damage
   Also note that it is not necessary to use the total +6 in bonuses on
every weapon.  This means that it is perfectly acceptable to have a +1 hit
long sword or a +3 damage club.

FYI: a training dagger: 1d3 damage
     a training club:   1d4 damage
     a training sword:  1d4 damage

TSR

   During the summer of 1994, TSR (tm) the makers of the role playing game
Dungeons & Dragons (tm) appeared on the internet and promptly began to
threaten anyone caught 'violating their copyright' on their products
(basically using their products over the net) would be promptly sued.
Therefore do not use any material from TSR sources.  It is also a good idea
not to use any material from copyrighted sources directly because that is
plagiarism and a no-no also.  If you can find the word in a standard
dictionary (single word and names, not phrases) it should be safe to use.
   Names like ogre, orc, elf, dragon, giant, kobold, vampire are ok since
they are from folklore and mythology and have existed way before TSR (tm)
used them in their books.   Remember, the word on the net is that TSR stands
for They Sue Regardless.

FLAG/FLAGS

   Flags with an asterisk after them in the online building editor are
either unimplemented as of yet or not usually settable for one reason or
another.  Either way if there is a flag with an asterisk, do not use without
consultation with Ponder.


STYLE


  o General Style: Indent all paragraphs three spaces.  Between the end of
    one sentence and the beginning of another there should be two spaces.
    Small areas with well written rooms and unique descriptions are more
    desirable than larger areas comprised of poorly written or cloned rooms.

  o Room names: capitalize first letters of words in room names other than
    (an, the, a, of, for, and) in room names, unless it is the first word of
    the room name, then it is capitalized.  Room names should be general and
    vague in nature if they outside a town or city limits.  Avoid room names
    such as 'The Lair of the Red Dragon'.  A better name would be 'A Cave
    with Charred Walls'.

  o Room descriptions: Room descriptions should be no less that three lines
    in length and no greater than fifteen lines in length (unless the room
    is uniquely special).  Make sure no line is more than seventy-seven
    characters in length and (if possible) no less than 70 characters in
    length.  Indent all paragraphs (including the first paragraph) by three
    spaces. Between each sentence, there should be two spaces.
       Refrain from placing in your room descriptions objects that can be
    removed or mobs that can be killed.  Since there is an autoexit feature,
    it is not necessary to write obvious exits into a room description.
    Closable doors, however, need to have mention in the room description.
       Refrain from using descriptions more than once.  This goes for
    virtually every type of terrain: road, desert, forest, field, river,
    etc...  However, one exception is large expanses of ocean.

 o  Room extras: room extras are an important part of making a mud world
    seem more realistic and divulging information about secret doors and
    such.  As a general rule of thumb, if in the room description there is
    something that could be looked at mentioned in the description, it then
    should have an extra.
       With extra keywords, try to include both singular and plural forms of
    the keyword.  Example: wall walls, bush bushes, tree trees.  Many
    keywords can be entered in the same extra making it unnecessary to make
    a separate extra for wall and walls, for example.

SCALE/SIZE

   As a general rule, normal sized rooms used for roads (and roads only) is
one tenth of a mile in length.  For hallways inside dungeons and other
buildings and roads within a town, room length should be figured to be about
ten to twenty feet in length.  Normal "room" size is anywhere from 10'x'10'
to about 40'x40'.  If your concept of the "room" is larger than this,
consider making several rooms to be that one "room".  Example: the Storage
Closet is one room, but the Grand Throne Room is three (all with the same
name--the added two rooms implies a greater size).

see also: STYLE


OBJECT/OBJECTS

o Use the indefinite articles (ie: a, an) or the definite article (ie: the)
  in your short descriptions.

o The name of your object is better known as the keyword.  Since the mud
  takes the first word in the name list for certain objects, please make
  sure that the first word in your name list is the object's primary noun.
  Example, the object: a red jeweled sceptre, name would be sceptre red
  jeweled.  If the the object name was red jeweled sceptre, in some actions
  done with the sceptre, the messages to the players would be red, rather
  than with sceptre.  This is particularly important with food items.

o With food objects, please write an action description.  The action
  description is what the food object tastes like.

o Please take the time to write an extra description for your objects.  On
  most muds, you can look at 1000 objects and 'You see nothing special...'
  all 1000 times.  In an effort to make this mud different and better, take
  the time to write a short extra description for your object.  Think of an
  object's extra description as the same thing as a mob's description when
  you look at it, which it actually is.  (For the extra's keywords, use the
  same words you used as the object's name.)
