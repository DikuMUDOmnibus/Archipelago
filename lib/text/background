ARCHIPELAGO is designed to be a classless skills/stats oriented game. To
this end we have several stats that probably do not exist on other
muds. Here is a list of the stats and their abbreviations:

	Strength 	Str (physical strength)
	Intelligence	Int (intelligence)
	Wisdom		Wis (wisdom)
	Constitution	Con (physical robustness)
	Dexterity	Dex (dexterity)
	Charisma	Chr (personality charm etc. )
	Perception	Per (how observant you are)
	Guile		Gui (how sneaky you can be)
	Focus		Foc (how well you can concentrate *)
	Devotion	Dev (basically how religious you are *)

When your stats are generated the total will be constant - so there is
little point in re-rolling ad-nausiam. You will also be allowed to
distribute a number of points to your stats to tailor them to your
personal taste - no stat can be set higher that 23.

After you have chosen your stats, you must choose a race. Race stat
bonuses are on top of your current stats. So you can end up with stats
greater than 23.

Most skills depend on several (up to 3) different stats. Broadly speaking
however strength and dexterity are required for fighting, Intelligence for
mage-spell casting, guile is useful for thieving, charisma helps bard skills
etc.

There are currently 5 guilds in town: Mage, Cleric, Warrior, Thief and Bard.

more guilds are planned but their location and skills they make available
may not be announced.
