<b>Repairing and Resizing Equipment</b>
<p>
Items that no longer perform as they should, are worn out, or broken, can
be fixed at a craftsperson.  Not all items can be fixed and resized by any
craftsperson, you have to find the right one who can do the type of work
you want done for the item.  There are armors, weapons, treasures, worn,
and other object types.
