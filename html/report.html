REPORT
<p>
This command sends a report of your current and max hp and mana to your
group.  You can use this command to let potential rescuers know how
low your hps are without forcing them to use the <a 
href="group.html">GROUP</a> command.  It is
designed as a convenience for groups with members who get lag or have slow
modems.
