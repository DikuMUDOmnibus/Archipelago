<b>WAKE SLEEP REST SIT STAND</b>
<p>
   Used to change your current activity, or inactivity, be it may sitting,
standing, resting,asleeping, or fighting.  If you feel weary, it is a good
idea to sit down and rest awhile, maybe even catch a few winks.
<p>
   Note, if you are asleep with negative movement, you are in deep sleep.
Arousing from deep sleep is difficult at best, but can be done.  If attacked
while in deep sleep, you may not immediately wake up.
