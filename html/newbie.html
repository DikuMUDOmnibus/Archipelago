<b>NEWBIES: Getting Started</b>
<p>
   Welcome to Archipelago! You have chosen a wondrous realm to explore full
 of high adventure, great
comradeship, and fantastic treasure.  Before you venture forth into the lands,
there are a few tips and tricks you should know to make your hard life here a
wee bit easier.
<p>
First, give yourself a <href = "title.html">title</a> by typing 'title %n the great!'.  The %n in
the title is your name and is necessary.  Other %codes includable in your new
title are: %r (room name you are in); %c (your race); %l (your level); and
%o (the opponent you are fighting).  You can also add <a href = "ansi.html">
colour</a> to your title to give it that special pizzazz.
<p>
Second, although the Gods are generally stingy and not given to bouts of
gift giving, they recognize that you are new on the Archipelago and have
granted you some equipment.  Type 'i' (inventory), and 'eq' (equipment), to
see what has been bestowed upon you.  Your equipment has been resized to
personally fit you.  If you notice, there is a sword nestled in a scabbard.
To use that weapon, type 'draw'.  To sheathe it, type 'sheathe'.
<p>
Third, if at some time during your stay here you grow hungry, the Gods mercifully
have given you two loaves of coarse wheat bread.  To eat this meal, type
'eat bread'. If you become thirsty, there are fountains and rivers filled
with water throughout the lands.
<p>
   Fourth, after leveling you should visit the various guilds and wandering
guildmasters to obtain new skills, spells, and weapon proficiencies.  At the
guildmaster, type 'learn' (for skills), 'study' (for spells), and 'train'
(for weapons).  When you wish to know something, type '(learn|study|train)
(# of levels) (desired knowledge)'.  As an example, to learn four levels of
magic theory, type `learn 4 magic'.  The difficulty, or ease, in learning
skills, spells and weapons is determined by your ability statistics.
<p>
   Fifth, you will need a place to rent when you are tired.  The nearest inn
is the Warrior's Widow.  The receptionist can be found 2 west, 1 north, and
1 up from the fountain.  Type `d' (down) to visit the fountain and enter the
lands of Archipelago!
<p>
Sixth, you will probably want to start gaining experience.  The best way to do this is to start 
slowly at first.  Try taking on the various bugs and other small critters that surround the 
fountain.  Creatures such as doodlebugs, ants, beetles, zinkozoovers, slimy slitherers, warty 
toads, magpies, and sparrows all make excellent fodder for your sword.
<p>
   Best of luck!  Please feel free to ask for help, and do not feel shy in
directing any comments, complaints, or suggestions you may have on the
various boards about town.  To write on a board type `write (name of topic)'.
