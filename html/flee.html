<b>Staying Alive: FLEE</b>
<p>
If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little uncomfortable
(maybe your are dying), just type 'flee', and presto! you are out of 
harm's way
- that is, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit doesn't 
simply
bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, who wants to live forever?
