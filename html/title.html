<b>TITLE</b>
<p>
The <b>TITLE</b> command sets the title others will see when they walk into a
room and on the <b>WHO</b> list.  Parentheses (the '(' and ')' characters) are
reserved for flags and consequently unavailable for use in titles.  Minimum
requirements for your title is your name, which is represented by %n.
<p>
Titles on Archipelago are more flexible than can be found on most other 
muds.  Immortals of Daemon and greater can set titles to exclude the 
%n (name) of the person from their title. <i>So beware, some people may 
not be who they seem to be.</i>
<p>

<b>Title %Codes:</b>
<ul>
<li>   %n ... name <b>(required to be in your title string)</b>
<li>   %c ... racial adjective (ie: Elven for Elf)
<li>   %l ... level
<li>   %o ... opponent (the opponent your are fighting)
<li>   %r ... room (the room in which your are currently in)
<li>   %t ... official title <blink>***Coming Soon***</blink>
</ul> 
<p>
Color also can be put into your title using Archipelago's ANSI %codes.
<p>


Example for the newbie player 'Wiglaf':
<pre>
: title %n of Wivernhoe the level %l %o slayer.
</pre>
This would give Wiglaf the title when he is not engaged in combat:
<p>
<pre>Wiglaf of Wivernhoe the level 1 nobody slayer.
</pre>
<p>
and when in combat:
<p>
<pre>
Wiglaf of Wivernhoe the level 1 lorshroompest slayer.
</pre>
