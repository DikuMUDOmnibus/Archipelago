<b>Casting a spell: INVOKE</b>
<p>
For "magical" people. If you want to throw a spell at someone or something.
<p>
Example : invoke 'blade of shivering ice' {player}
   Note that the name of the spell must be enclosed by " ' "s.
<p>
There are two modifiers that can be used with the invoke command:<br>
-novoice -nogesture
<p>
-novoice     means you will not be seen to utter the spell<br>
-nogesture   means you will not make gestures when casting
<p>
each of the options adds to the difficulty of casting the spell.
<p>
If you are underwater and not able to breath water you will automatically
cast spells with -novoice and incur the penalty.  Similarly if for any
reason you cannot speak - e.g. you have something in your mouth they you 
againincur the -novoice penalty.
<p>
If you are underwater and do not have 'free action' then you will 
automatically cast with -nogesture and incure the casting penalty.  The 
same is true if you
try to cast whilst holding something or wielding a twohanded weapon  or
wielding two weapons - i.e. you must have at least 1 hand free to cast 
without
the -nogesture penalty.
<p>
There will be times when casting without these option could cause you to be
attacked.
