<b>! ^</b>
<p> 
Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.
<p> 
Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"  For example:
<pre> 
: tell mycrof Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.
 
: ^mycrof^mycroft
You tell Mycroft, 'Hi there, how are you?'
 
> ^you^you doing^
You tell Mycroft, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'
</pre>
