<b>LOOK</b>
<p>
Look is a useful command for gaining information and studying your 
surroundings. You can <b>LOOK</b> in many different ways.<br>
<ul>
<li><b>LOOK</b> alone looks at the room or area you are currently in.<br>
<li><b>LOOK (N, S, E, W, U, D)</b> will look in a certain direction.<br>
<li><b>LOOK AT (object or being)</b> will able you to look at a specific 
thing. Note: if you <b>LOOK AT CORPSE</b>, you will not see what its 
inventory, but its description. To look inside something, you must...<br>
<li><b>LOOK IN (object and/or container name)</b> will show you the 
contents of a container. If the container is linked to a room, you will 
normally see the containers exits and description.<br>
<li><b>LOOK OUT</b> is not only what you would shout if something was 
going to attack your comrades, but is also a useful command for seeing 
what lies on the outside of a container. This command is usable only when 
the exits show Leave as a possibility.<br>
<li><b>LOOK BOARD</b> is how you would see what messages have been posted 
to a bulletin board. Note, you need to be actually by a bulletin board 
for this to work. To read a message, you would <b>READ (message number)</b>.
<li><b>LOOK ME</b> or <b>LOOK SELF</b> will allow you to look upon your 
own self... you handsome devil.
</ul>
LOOK

Usage: LOOK [ {keyword} | at | {dir} | in | out | at | me | room ]

<ul>

<li>Look without any options will re-display the room, its name, description,
  exits, and whoever and whatever is in the room, as if you are entering it
  for the first time.

<li>The {keyword} option is used to look at something/someone in the room.  It
  can also be used to look at something specific that was mentioned in the
  room's description.  Many rooms have secret keywords embedded into the text,
  and are often clues that can safe your life, hints to where a treasure is
  buried, or simply there to enrich your roleplaying adventures.

<li>The 'at' option is not necessary, simply omitting it while looking at
  something will work just the same.

<li>The {dir} option is used to look in a specific direction.  This option may
  yield important hints/clues about nearby rooms, if available.

<li>The 'in' option looks into a container and displays its contents.  In the
  case of container exits, 'look in {object}' will show the room the container
  links to.  Container exits can be entered, and things can be placed into the
  room simply by putting stuff into the container.

<li>The 'out' option is used to look out of a room you are in.  The 'out' option
  works only if there is a 'leave' exit available.  If none is available, the
  first exit leading outdoors will be used instead.

<li>The 'me' or 'self' option looks at yourself, displays what equipment you
  have on, and your character's description.
</ul>
