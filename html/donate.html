<b>DONATE</b>
<p>
This command takes an object that you no longer want and deposits it in the
donation shop in either Lamman, Abernach or Wivernhoe, to assist newbies in
getting started.  There is a small chance that an item will get junked 
when it is donated.  Money donated goes to the poor box just inside the 
Temple of Small Gods in Lamman.
