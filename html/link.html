<b>LINK</b>
<p> 
Many people mudding from the USA have problems with their links to 
the Archipelago. As most of the immortal staff on Archipelago is from 
the US, we sympathize greatly with this problem.  Poor or slow links can 
be not only irksome when holding a conversation, but also very hazardous to 
your health in the middle of a battle, of course. <p>
<ol>
<li> If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.
<p>
<li>If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.
</ol> 
    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
