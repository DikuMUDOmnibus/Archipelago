<b>ANSI "COLOR"</b>
<p>
If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.
<pre>
> color off
This command disables all color.

> color sparse
> color normal
> color complete
</pre>
These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.
<p>
Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.
<p>
Personalized ANSI color can be used in prompts and titles, see <a href = 
"ansi.html">ANSI</a> for more information.<p>
