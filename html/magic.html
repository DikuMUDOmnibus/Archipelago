MAGIC INVOKE TECHNIQUE FORM SPELLS
</b>
<p>
Magic in this world is powerful, diverse and useful.  Anyone with the
necessary knowledge can, with modest success, produce a simple cantrip.
However, to truly excel as a magus with a calling in the arcane arts
requires dedication and a vast reservoir of time, something not everyone
can afford.
<p>
There are fifteen magical arts divided into five Techniques and ten Forms
that, along with Magical Theory, form the arcane body of knowledge we refer
to as magic.
<p>  
Spells are composed of formulas combining a Technique and a Form.  These
combinations are merely classificatory, and not used to invoke the spell
itself, e.g., the 'bind wounds' spell is 'creo corpus' magic.  Virtually
any spell, both known and unknown to the magus, can be invoked as follows:
<p>
<pre>
<b>     INVOKE [-nogesture] [-novoice] 'spell name' (target)
</b></pre>
Note: stuff in brackets [] are optional.
<p>
Spells will incur no penalty to the magus if successfully cast.  If spell
casting is blotched, loss of movement points, and other harmful side effects
can occur.  A blotched spell will sometimes offer the magus new insight and
improved magical ability toward future spell casting.  Extremely fatigued
magicians, often requiring sleep and prolonged rest, will not be able to
invoke spells until suitably recovered.
<p>   
There are two conditions to successful spell casting: studying and casting.
<ul><b>Studying:</b><br>
<ul>   One's stats in Intelligence, Wisdom, and proficiencies in Magic 
Theory, Techniques,
and Forms determine what spells you can, or are allowed to study.  The higher
your stats and proficiencies, the higher the spell level you can study at.
<p>   So, as an example, if you have a high creo (a tech), a high ignem (a 
form),
and a low corpus (a form), all it means is that you can study higher level
'creo ignem' spells than possible with 'creo corpus'.
</ul><br>
<b>Casting:</b><br>
<ul>The more proficiency you have in a spell, the less chance of blotching
will occur when the spell invoked.  Your Focus stat may affect spell
duration and concentration.
</ul>
</ul>
