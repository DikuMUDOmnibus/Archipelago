<b>Getting together: GROUP</b>
<p>
<pre>
Usage : GROUP [person]
        GROUP all
</pre>
<p>
<b>GROUP</b> with no arguments shows the status of your group. <b>GROUP 
(person)</b> adds or removes (person) from your group.  <b>GROUP ALL</b> 
adds everyone who is following you to your group.
<p>
If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of wherther the group members have been
participating in the fight.
<p>
Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.
<p>
To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
<p>
Each person in the group, by using "group <person_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.
<p>
Example:
<p>
Ratatosk and Saladin wishes to group with Ansalon.
<p>
<pre>
Ratatosk: follow ansalon
Saladin : follow ansalon
(Ansalon should be following no one but himself)
Ansalon : group all
</pre>
<p>
Later when Ansalon becomes upset at Ratatosk (because he is eating acorns all 
the time) he types: <b>GROUP RATATOSK</b> to kick Ratatosk out of the group.
