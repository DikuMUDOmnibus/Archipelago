<b>Using Scabbards: DRAW & SHEATHE</b>
<p>
Cool commands... 'nuff said.
<p>
However, if you are really curious... 
When wearing a scabbard and a weapon, such as a sword, you can 
SHEATHE a wielded sword.  This places the blade in the scabbard.  If you 
wish to fight something or someone, DRAW your weapon.  By doing so, you 
will instantly wield your weapon.  Also, if you are jumped by an 
aggresive monster or person, you will automatically draw your weapon 
and begin to fight. Note: these two commands only work if you are 
wearing or carrying a scabbard.
