<b>INNS: OFFER and RENT</b>
<p>
When you feel tired and want to leave the Archipelago, find an inn or a 
similar
place to <b>RENT</b>.  This insures that your equipment will be stored away 
safely,
and made available when you return to the Archipelago.  Renting will usually
cost something depending on the quality of your equipment.  At the 
innkeeper, type <b>OFFER</b>
to see how much this cost will be, and note the number of days you can rent
with the gold you are carrying on hand and deposited in the banks.
<p>
If you run out of money while rented, money will be taken out of your 
bank account,
and when that runs out, items from your inventory will be seized to cover
the cost of your rent (items will be seized when you come out of rent, and
not before).
<p>
Characters that have been link-dead for a while will be eventually be force-rented at a higher surcharge than it normally costs to rent.
