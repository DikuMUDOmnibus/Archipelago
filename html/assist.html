<b>All for one and one for all: ASSIST</b>
<pre>
Usage: ASSIST {person in need}
</pre>
If Max is being beaten senseless by a hemogoblin and you feel brave enough
to help him, type ASSIST MAX to hit the hemogoblin.  Note that the 
hemogoblin will keep hitting Max; assist only makes you start to fight whomever 
you're trying to assist.
