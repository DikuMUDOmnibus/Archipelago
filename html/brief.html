<b>BRIEF</b>
<p>
Toggle "brief mode".  When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of
the room you are in; only the name of the room, the exits, and the beings 
and objects there.
<p>
While on Archipelago, it is not recommended to ever toggle on the "brief 
mode".  Builders here often change the rooms and areas after they become 
over explored and stale.  So unless you are very familiar with the area 
in which you are travelling, however even then, it is not advisable to use 
this command.
<p>
Frequently, you will find
small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!
